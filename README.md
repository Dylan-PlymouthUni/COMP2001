# COMP2001 Trail API Microservice

This repository contains the **Trail API Microservice** developed for the COMP2001 coursework. The microservice provides CRUD functionality to manage trail data and integrates with Flask, SQLAlchemy, JWT authentication, and Docker for deployment. 

The microservice provides the following features: 
- Full CRUD operations for managing trails (Create, Read, Update, Delete). 
- Secure authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens). 
- External authentication API integration: `https://web.socem.plymouth.ac.uk/COMP2001/auth/api/users`. 
- Swagger UI for API documentation: [http://127.0.0.1:5000/swagger](http://127.0.0.1:5000/swagger). 
- Dockerized for consistent and easy deployment.
